                    <p>The Canada Disability Benefit is a new federal income-tested benefit that provides annual financial support to eligible working-age individuals with severe and prolonged disabilities. The benefit provides monthly payments based on your income tax information from the previous year. Once approved, you do not need to reapply annually—Service Canada will review your eligibility each year automatically.</p>

                    <h4>Benefit Amount</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maximum Payment:</strong> $200 per month or $2,400 per year</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Schedule:</strong> Payments are issued on the third Thursday of each month</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Eligibility Requirements</h4>
                    <p>To qualify for the Canada Disability Benefit, you must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be approved for the Disability Tax Credit (DTC)</li>
                        <li>Be aged 18–64 years</li>
                        <li>Have filed a 2024 federal tax return (you and your spouse/common-law partner, if applicable)</li>
                        <li>Be a Canadian resident for tax purposes</li>
                        <li>Have one of these statuses: Canadian citizen, permanent resident, registered under the Indian Act, or temporary resident in Canada for 18+ months</li>
                        <li>Not be incarcerated in federal prison for 2+ years</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Retroactive Payments</h4>
                    <p>The Canada Disability Benefit can provide retroactive payments for up to 24 months from when your application is received and approved, but payments cannot extend to any period before June 2025.</p>

                    <p>The Disability Tax Credit is a non-refundable tax credit that helps people with disabilities, or their supporting family member, reduce the amount of income tax they may have to pay. If your application is approved, you may claim the disability amount on your tax return. The DTC is non-refundable, meaning it can help you pay less taxes, but you will not get any money back.</p>

                    <h4>Benefit Amount</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Base Amount:</strong> $10,138 for 2025</li>
                        <li><strong>Supplement for Children:</strong> An additional $5,914 for individuals under 18 years of age</li>
                        <li><strong>Provincial Credit:</strong> An additional provincial tax credit is also available (varies by province, typically 5–10% of the disability amount)</li>
                        <li><strong>Retroactive Claims:</strong> The credits can be claimed retroactively, going back up to 10 years</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Eligibility Requirements</h4>
                    <p>You may be eligible for the DTC if a medical practitioner certifies that you have a severe and prolonged impairment in one of the categories, significant limitations in two or more categories, or receive therapy to support a vital function. Your impairment must meet the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are unable to do the activity, or it takes 3 times longer than someone of similar age without the impairment, even with the use of appropriate therapy, medication, and devices</li>
                        <li>This restriction is present all or almost all of the time (generally at least 90%)</li>
                        <li>The restriction has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Income Requirements</h4>
                    <p>All income levels should apply for the DTC. The DTC is available to individuals with any level of income, including patients receiving disability assistance, patients who work full time, and those with no income.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why apply even with no income:</strong> Being approved for the DTC can help you get access to other federal, provincial, or territorial programs. The DTC is a prerequisite for several important benefits and programs, making it essential to apply regardless of your income level.</p>

                    <h4>When to Apply</h4>
                    <p>Apply any time using the digital application form or paper form. Apply for the DTC if you think you may be eligible, even if you have no income to report. If the CRA approves your application, the DTC may help you access other federal programs.</p>

                    <h4>Programs the DTC Provides Access To</h4>
                    <p>Being approved for the DTC unlocks eligibility for many other federal, provincial, and territorial benefits:</p>

                    <p>The Guaranteed Access Program (GAP) is a Final Expense life insurance product designed to provide a one-time, tax-free payout (minimum $10,000) to a person's loved ones at the time of their passing. This program is offered through Canadian insurers and guarantees coverage for people with disabilities and long term medical conditions who might otherwise have difficulty obtaining traditional life insurance, helping to ensure funeral and final expenses don't become a financial burden on their families during an already difficult time.</p>

                    <p>The Canadian Dental Care Plan is helping make the cost of dental care more affordable for eligible Canadian residents. The CDCP is managed by Health Canada and administered by Sun Life. This federal program provides coverage for dental services for Canadians who do not have access to private dental insurance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The CDCP does not provide free dental care. It covers a part of the cost of your care. You may have to pay the portion of costs that are not covered.</p>

                    <h4>Coverage Amount</h4>
                    <p>Income-Based Co-Payments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Income under $70,000:</strong> 100% coverage (no co-payment)</li>
                        <li><strong>Income $70,000–$79,999:</strong> 60% coverage (40% co-payment)</li>
                        <li><strong>Income $80,000–$89,999:</strong> 40% coverage (60% co-payment)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Additional costs may apply if your dental services exceed CDCP reimbursement rates or include non-covered services.</p>

                    <h4>Services Covered</h4>
                    <p>The CDCP will help pay a portion of the cost for a wide range of oral health care services:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preventive:</strong> Exams, cleanings, polishing, fluoride treatments, X-rays</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Fillings, simple extractions</li>
                        <li><strong>Major:</strong> Root canals, crowns, oral surgeries</li>
                        <li><strong>Periodontal:</strong> Deep cleanings, scaling and root planing</li>
                        <li><strong>Prosthodontic:</strong> Complete and partial dentures, denture repairs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some services require preauthorization before treatment.</p>

                    <h4>Eligibility Requirements</h4>
                    <p>You must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Private Dental Insurance:</strong> No coverage through employer, family member's employer, pension benefits, or private plans</li>
                        <li><strong>Income:</strong> Adjusted family net income less than $90,000</li>
                        <li><strong>Tax Filing:</strong> You and your spouse/common-law partner (if applicable) must have filed Canadian tax returns for the previous year</li>
                        <li><strong>Residency:</strong> Canadian resident for tax purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If you have dental coverage through a provincial, territorial, or federal government social program, you can still qualify. Coverage will be coordinated between the plans.</p>

                    <h4>When to Apply</h4>
                    <p>All eligible Canadians can now apply for the Canadian Dental Care Plan. Apply before you need dental care, as coverage only begins on your official start date. You will need to renew your coverage every year to confirm you still meet the eligibility requirements.</p>

                    <p>Canada Pension Plan disability benefits are designed to provide partial income replacement to eligible Canada Pension Plan contributors who are under the age of 65 and have a severe and prolonged disability. This is a taxable monthly payment for individuals who have contributed to the CPP during their working years and can no longer work due to their disability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Benefits start 4 months after you are deemed disabled. You may receive up to a maximum of 12 months of retroactive payments from the date Service Canada received your application.</p>

                    <h4>Benefit Amount</h4>
                    <p>Disability Pension (2026):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> $1,741.20 per month</li>
                        <li><strong>Average:</strong> $1,191.72 per month</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Children's Benefit:</strong> Children of CPP disability beneficiaries are also eligible for a monthly benefit up to age 18, or up to age 25 if they are attending school part-time or full-time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Benefit Ends:</strong> At age 65, your CPP disability benefit automatically converts to a CPP retirement pension.</p>

                    <h4>Eligibility Requirements</h4>
                    <p>You must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Between 18 and 64 years old</li>
                        <li><strong>CPP Contributions:</strong> You contributed enough years to the CPP before you first became severely disabled and have been continuously disabled since that time</li>
                        <li><strong>Severe Disability:</strong> Your condition prevents you from working at any job regularly (not just your previous job). A substantially gainful occupation is a job that pays wages equal to or greater than the maximum annual amount a person could receive as a disability pension. In 2026, this amount is $20,971.45 (before tax)</li>
                        <li><strong>Prolonged Disability:</strong> Your disability is long-term and of indefinite duration, or is likely to result in death</li>
                        <li><strong>Work Earnings:</strong> If you earn less than $7,400 (before tax), this should not affect your disability benefits. If you earn between $7,400 and $20,971.45 (before tax), this may demonstrate that you are regularly capable of working and it may affect your disability benefits</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>When to Apply</h4>
                    <p>Apply as soon as you develop a severe and prolonged disability that prevents you from working regularly at any job. You may still qualify for CPP disability benefits even if you stopped working a while ago or didn't apply right away.</p>
                    <p><strong>Processing Time:</strong> It can take up to 120 days (4 months) for Service Canada to make a decision on your application.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you live in Quebec, apply to the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) instead.</p>

                    <p>To apply for the DTC, you must complete Form T2201 (Disability Tax Credit Certificate), which has two parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Part A:</strong> Completed by you (the applicant)</li>
                        <li><strong>Part B:</strong> Completed and certified by a qualified medical practitioner (doctor, nurse practitioner, or specialist)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The CRA evaluates your application based on functional limitations (how your condition affects daily activities), not the diagnosis itself.</p>

                    <h4>When to Apply on Your Own</h4>
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Many applications are denied due to incorrect completion, not lack of eligibility</li>
                        <li>Doctors often focus on diagnoses instead of functional limitations</li>
                        <li>Missing key wording or improper framing can lead to rejection of valid applications</li>
                    </ul>
